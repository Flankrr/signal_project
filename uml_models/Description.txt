Alert generation system
The Alert Generation System is designed to continuously monitor patient data and generate alerts based on predefined criteria. The main classes involved are AlertGenerator, Alert, AlertManager, DataStorage, and PatientIdentifier. AlertGenerator is responsible for generating alerts. It maintains alertStates to track the alert status of each patient and uses methods like generate to evaluate data and potentially trigger alerts. Alert represents the alert itself, including the patient's ID, the triggering condition, and a timestamp. It provides methods to access these attributes. AlertManager manages the lifecycle of alerts, sending them to medical staff and handling their acknowledgment and resolution. DataStorage stores and retrieves patient data, enabling the system to access historical data for more accurate alert generation. PatientIdentifier retrieves patient details, ensuring that alerts are correctly attributed to the right patient. The design ensures clear separation of responsibilities, with each class focusing on a specific aspect of the alert generation process. This modularity allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The classes interact through well-defined methods, enabling efficient data flow and decision-making. This system design enhances patient care by ensuring timely and accurate alert generation and management.

alert state diagram 
The state diagram outlines the lifecycle of an alert within the system, illustrating the various states an alert undergoes from generation to resolution. Initially, an alert is in the "Generated" state when patient data meets predefined threshold criteria, indicating an abnormal condition. Once the alert is created, it transitions to the "Sent" state, meaning it has been dispatched to the medical staff's monitoring systems and mobile devices. This ensures that the alert captures immediate attention for prompt medical intervention. When a staff member acknowledges the alert, either manually or automatically, it moves to the "Acknowledged" state, preventing further notifications of the same alert. Finally, the alert can be resolved in two ways: automatically, if subsequent patient data shows normal readings continuously for a predefined period, indicating that the condition has stabilized; or manually, if a staff member resolves it after assessing the patient and addressing the condition. The state diagram captures every critical stage in the alert's lifecycle, providing a clear and systematic path from detection to resolution, ensuring timely and appropriate responses to patient conditions.

alert sequence diagram 
The sequence diagram provides a detailed depiction of the process involved in alert generation and handling. The process begins with the HeartRateMonitor sending heart rate data to the AlertGenerator. The AlertGenerator then retrieves historical data for the patient from DataStorage to evaluate the current data against past trends and predefined criteria. If a condition is met, such as abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, the AlertGenerator creates an alert and sends it to the AlertManager. The AlertManager then sends notifications to the medical staff's monitoring systems and mobile devices, ensuring immediate attention. The medical staff acknowledges the alert, updating its state to "Acknowledged" to prevent repeated notifications. If the patient's condition stabilizes automatically or if the medical staff manually resolves the issue, the alert state transitions to "Resolved." This sequence diagram effectively captures the interaction between the components, highlighting critical steps such as data evaluation, alert creation, notification, and acknowledgment, ensuring a seamless and efficient flow of communication and actions within the alert generation system.

data access system
The Data Access System is designed to handle various incoming data streams and convert them into a standard format for further processing. The main classes involved are DataListener, DataParser, DataSourceAdapter, and PatientData. DataListener is an interface with concrete implementations like TCPDataListener, WebSocketDataListener, and FileDataListener, each tailored to specific data sources. These listeners capture incoming data and pass it to the DataParser. DataParser processes the raw data and converts it into a usable format. It uses the parse method to create PatientData objects, which include patient ID, metrics, and a timestamp. DataSourceAdapter then adapts these PatientData objects for storage and further use. This design ensures a clear separation of responsibilities, with each class focusing on a specific part of the data access process. The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The classes interact through well-defined methods, ensuring efficient data flow from raw input to standardized patient data. This system design enhances data handling by ensuring that diverse data sources are accurately captured, processed, and converted into a consistent format, ready for storage and analysis.

data storage system
The Data Storage System is designed to securely store, retrieve, and manage patient data. The main classes involved are DataStorage, PatientData, DataRetriever, and SecurityManager. DataStorage maintains a map of patient data and provides methods for storing, retrieving, and deleting data. It uses methods like storeData, retrieveData, and deleteData to handle these tasks. PatientData represents the patient's data, including patient ID, metrics, and a timestamp. It offers methods to access these attributes. DataRetriever interacts with DataStorage to fetch patient data and apply security checks. It ensures that data retrieval is secure and authorized. SecurityManager ensures data encryption and authorizes access based on user ID. It maintains the integrity and confidentiality of patient records by using methods like ensureEncryption and authorize. The design ensures clear separation of responsibilities, with each class focusing on a specific aspect of data storage and security. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The classes interact through well-defined methods, enabling efficient data flow and secure data management. This system design enhances patient care by ensuring that patient data is securely stored, accurately retrieved, and properly managed, maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.

patient identification system
The Patient Identification System is designed to ensure accurate matching and management of patient data. The main classes involved are PatientIdentifier, PatientRecord, DataStorage, and IdentityManager. The PatientIdentifier class maintains a map of patient records and provides methods to match patient IDs and retrieve records. It uses methods like matchPatientId and getPatientRecord to perform these tasks. PatientRecord represents the patient's information, including the patient ID, name, date of birth, and medical history. It offers methods to access these attributes. DataStorage stores and retrieves patient data, maintaining a data map that enables the system to access and update patient information. IdentityManager oversees the entire process, managing patient records and handling discrepancies. It ensures the integrity and consistency of patient data across the system. The design ensures clear separation of responsibilities, with each class focusing on a specific aspect of patient identification and data management. This modular approach allows for easy maintenance and scalability. The classes interact through well-defined methods, enabling efficient data flow and decision-making. This system design enhances patient care by ensuring accurate identification and secure management of patient data, preventing misidentification and medical errors.
